                          Dr. Hajime Asama has explained the service applications of robots and about his Service Robotics Laboratory (SRL). SRL discovers methodologies to innovate
                          services which satisfy uses and develops artificial systems. He involved application of research in two areas includes; development research in terms of
                          robotics, ambient intelligence and pattern recognition and fundamental research in terms of mobiligence. The main backgrounds of his presentation are
                          adaptive behavior is blocked by disorders like locomotor disorders. And Parkinson’s disease (Deep Brain Stimulation). He indicated new collaborative
                          approach, which is a combination of biology and engineering to biological system model. One of the experimental evidence to verify the hypothesis of
                          dopamine regulation in locomotor system for social behavior is by using biological system is the fighting behavior of male crickets, which indicates
                          the occurrence of dynamic feedback. Dr. Hajime Asama has explained the program structure by taking the real accident of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power
                          plant. The accident caused by earthquake, loss of power supply, Scarm, tsunami, damage of fuel

                                 Since it is difficult for the human beings to reach out the incident site because of the high radiation, his lab have developed remote controlled
                                  robots for remove fuel debris from the site. The important missions for this program are; stabilization of the cooling system, contaminant,
                                   decommission and reduction of radiation of workers. They have already developed a remotely controlled unmanned construction system for debris
                                   removal. The unmanned system were used in response against explosion of volcano, pyroclastic
                                flow and flow of debris. Dr. Hajime gave some useful information about the successful remotely controlled mobile robots, which includes;
                                PACKBOT (military applications), QUINCE(water contamination inspection), ROV; Remote Operated Vehicles(investigation in rock field),
                                TEPCO by Honda(investigation robots for high altitudes), Hitachi robots(debris removal), MHI- MEISTER ROBOT and BOAT type ROBOTS( detect leakage of
                                 water in veot pipes). During this mission, some robots got disconnected and lost. For these types of purposes, Hitachi and Toshiba have developed two types
                                  of transformable robots such snake and scorpion respectively. From the mission they could concluded the failure factors of their tasks including increase
                                   of threats in disaster and accidents and difficulty in utilization of robots and remotely controlled machines.

                                   Up next was the keynote talk by  Herve Le Treut. The theme of Herve Le Treut’s talk was climate change and the role that science plays with it.
                                   His works focused on numerical simulations on climatic change and he is working on understanding the phenomenon of climate change.
                                   He showed thermal images of the Earth’s surface, and the images clearly showed a rapid increase in the Earth’s temperature over the past century.
                                   He discussed the research done by the lPSL labs in Paris, which is a federation of 9 labs and about 1400 people. Herve Le Treut attended COP21,
                                   and said there were about 2000 participants from 100 countries. This proved to be a great opportunity to talk about the dire need to address
                                   climate change and how to combat it. He ended the session by saying that the scale of the climate change problem requires a huge educational effort
                                   to study the systemic type of changes. The presentation showed the differences in the temperature response by the end of the 21st century(1900-2100).
                                   As future climate trajectories by IPSL/IPCC 2013, states to keep under 2°C for the purpose of removing carbon dioxide and thus limiting the
                                    climate change. He also

                               This was followed by the keynote of Alaa Khamis. Alaa Khamis started his talk by giving an introduction to a humanitarian aspect of land mining
                               detection, and its socio impact on the society. The land mines are deadly weapons which operated by its own victims, which is also a mass destruction
                                by slow motion barrier for big obstacles. Land mines can be in different shapes, 2000 different types which create massive destruction, out of that
                                 650 are antipersonnel difficult to detect. “A landmine is a perfect soldier: Ever courageous never sleeps, never misses”. he added. The simplicity
                                 and cost-effectiveness of mines are major factors in explaining the widespread use of mines in several countries and they are also facing problems
                                 dealing with the mine contamination. The civilian-purpose demining or humanitarian demining aims at finding and removing abandoned landmines without
                                  any hazard to the environment. These landmines had been intended for military use when they were planted, but their duty has expired.
                                   The antipersonnel landmines can kill or incapacitate their victims. They deny access to land, and its resources. Each year, up to 20,000 new
                                   casualties
                             </p>

                               is caused by landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs): around 1,500 a month and 40 a day. Landmine injuries include blindness, burns,
                                and destroyed limbs and shrapnel wounds. Often the victim dies from the blast because they do not get to medical care in time.
                                They enabled a technology for landmine detection includes humanitarian demining and main field reconnaissance. Taking initiative they started
                                minesweeper in 2015 to detect mines which include the modules like detecting+mapping detection only where minesweeping industry mainly having
                                detection, identification and mapping. The ultimate goal of the Minesweepers competition is to put into practice to foster technological innovation
                                and excellence for the benefit of humanity” and to serve as an educational and a research forum to provide efficient, reliable, adaptive and
                                cost-effective solutions for the serious problem of humanitarian demining in many affected countries in the world. The competition also motivates
                                the participants to create new companies and industries geared towards minefield reconnaissance and mapping technologies. Moreover,
                                 the applicability of the robotic systems presented in this competition can be extended to a wide range of other applications such as security
                                 and surveillance, search and rescue, health monitoring of civil infrastructure, pipeline monitoring, and environment monitoring.

                               scientist of India, started his talk by commenting on the future of the current age technology. There are great advances in Science and Technology,
                                we witness exponential drive of it. The main characteristics of all these inventions are that even the inventor is not able to predict the future or
                                impact of their technology. In spite of the exponential growth in technology, we are facing different challenges across the world whose solutions
                                remain unknown. He also added that many of these problems have been created by technology itself. “Great rise of extremism and racism have brought
                                down the value of humans which made him ashamed of the human race. Now we have to request to machine to do different tasks.” The educational system
                                in India is failing because we never learn by doing or never learn by failure. He heavily stressed the point that education on microprocessors should
                                be implemented in the undergraduate programs in schools in India.

                                talk, as he was not able to come and attend the conference. Before he gave his talk, he expressed what an honour it was to be presenting for the RAHA
                                2016 conference. He introduced different projects in Drone America, which provide autonomous aircraft as the solution to some of the world’s
                                 challenging problems.He talked about machine solution systems: Aircrafts and systems for weather modifications and automated cloud seeding systems
                                  that can be adapted to be used in very dangerous environments.  He also talked about using unmanned aircrafts to carry water to subside wildfire,
                                   how can these be adapted to supply medicines and food in otherwise dangerous areas to help people survive long He talked about how autonomous
                                   systems can help people to survive long enough. He commented that machines are generally
                                  viewed as inanimate objects, but in reality, they come alive. They are an extension of our mind and our dream, since what is in your heart is
                                  transferred into your mind and then to your creativity.</p>

                               the motivation behind building human controlled robots which can assist and help medical workers and doctors to be safer in dangerous and contagious
                               environments such as during the spread of  Ebola. He explained how these robots were designed to assist the medical workers in using personal
                               protective equipment, how they can be used for the disposal of contaminated waste and also for laboratory tests. He said that they used to transport
                                blood samples of the patients by volunteers to far off places for testing. More than 20% of the time, they were not able to link the vial with the
                                 real patient information. This became the ideology to create a remote collection facility application was developed which that enabled to track the
                                  vials using GPS facility. Also, robots were equipped to monitor the status of the patients and to disinfect the beds and things that these patients.
                                  He ended the talk by saying innovations need to be forecasted for the betterment of mankind. </p>
