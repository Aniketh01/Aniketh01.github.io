                            <p class="text-justify">In the following coming blogs, I will be writing about what happened during the conference according to the schedule and will
                               write briefly about what the speakers and the delegate spoke about the robotics and their projects during the conference.  </p>

                                 <p class="text-justify">As I said I will brief you guys about what these speakers talked during these 3 days in 3 different blog posts.
                                   The day started of by a warm welcome to all the speakers, delegates and other. We all had the breakfast and entered the sessions.
                                   First was the plenary talk by Ronald Arkin.

                                He gave a very detailed overview on the applications of robotics in different areas like military, health care etc. and the challenges in developing
                                 (architecture) such robots not by compromising the safety and security of the human beings. He started with a phrase “100 dollar laptops failed when
                                 cell phones have gained popularity. Why?” The first part of his talk dealt with talking about the military use of robots, especially in terms of
                                 reducing innocent casualties. He mentioned that a big challenge was to ensure that the robots obey humanitarian laws to ensure minimal loss of life
                                  to these innocent people. The second part of his talk was around ways that the way that robots could deal with diseases such as Parkinson’s disease
                                   and stigmatization. He also showed demos of various robots that could detect emotion, such as interjecting when someone raises their voice in anger,
                                    and also to stop playing when detecting anger or other negative emotions. The final part of his talk was about deception, and how deception-based
                                    models in robots can be good.

                                  Dr. Brad Nelson was presented via skype from Hong Kong. He gave a online talk via skype from Hong Kong. He started his talk by acknowledging his
                                  team members from Multiscale robotics labs (MSRL). He gave a small glimpse of the works happening in their lab where they try to understand the
                                  mechanobiology of very small devices, magnetics based medical robots, micro and nano robots, material and fabrications.
                                  He went ahead with Micro-nano robotics for medical diagnostics and analysis. He took us through the basic terms and its history like
                                  Cyborg surgeons which was projected as half machine and half surgeons through advertisements. Prof. Russ Taylor from John Hopkins has been
                                  regarded as the father of medical robotics which works on 2 loops the inner loop which is mostly used and outer loop which deals with feedbacks
                                   and regarded as a time taking process. In his talk he focussed on the inner loop component which is now used in different areas in the field of
                                    medicine. It was in the 2000s that the first commercial device with inner loop was come into market and this might have got inspiration from the old english
                                    movie Fantastic voyage(1966),

                               in which the machines are shrunk to understand what is inside the blood vessels. These devices use the concept of magnetism where forces
                               (changes in magnetism) and torque (rotating) play a major role. He looked at eye with cataract and fixed vision with electromagnets.which in the 1974
                                was done by injecting into the lens and spin to liquefy the lens nucleus. First prototype that his team had developed was octomag which could very
                                 precisely control the small device with 8 diff coils. An example he used was on a disease condition Age-related macular degeneration(AMD)which occurs
                                  the retinal cells of elderly people forming vasculature. Treatment was to inject medicines like Avastin, Lucentis etc. into the ocular cavity but was
                                   found to be not specific to vasculature area. That is when microbots started taking the place of medicines which are specific and tested on animal
                                    models like rabbit eye that were magnetically driven. He continued his talk with another example i.e. heart where catheters are used to make
                                    ablations based on forces and torques put forward on kidney by Hans Tillande in 1951--catheter in kidney systems. Aeon phocus, an electromagnetic
                                    catheter steering systems which was first installed in Vitecan. “SDG(sustainable Development Goal) cannot be achieved without the explicitly
                                    addressing one of the most crucial needs facing the world: a lack of access to surgery”. He then went forward explaining the application of using
                                     both octomag and catheter to capsulorhexis to treat cataract achieved by injecting the device for that a prototype device with 4+3 DOF was
                                     designed. Flagellum based bots can also be build where it can swim in different direction and also generate the force and torque based on the
                                     motion. But all these things have different challenges like viewing surgery in the eye, safety measures. He also includes as a general
                                     information for the eye there is no vision based bots as the smallest camera is 1mm cube.

                               Dr. Bernardine Dias was an associate research professor at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and the creator and director of
                               TechBridgeWorld. She delivered a talk on ‘Prioritizing Humans in Humanitarian Technology Applications’. Her work is basically on innovative technology
                                that empowers underserved communities in a manner that is culturally relevant and locally sustainable. Her contributions in this field have aided to
                                understand how technology bridge the world. She gave a brief idea about TechBridgeWorld, a program at Carnegie Mellon University in which students use
                                 technology to help underdeveloped countries. Also she mentioned about iSTEP (Innovative Student Technology ExPerience), a student internship program
                                  and their innovations that they put to use in countries like Tanzania and Ghana. Her team have developed the Electronic Braille Tutor, a device that
                                   help the blind population in learning written braille. “In Tanzania, many teachers of blind students are blind themselves, and if the audio is
                                   there to correct any mistakes, it saves the teacher from having to rewrite the students’ work themselves,” she added.

                             This inspired them to add the audio feature to the Braille Tutor and it became very useful in training blind students. In their study, they have used
                             six different types of Braille. Students were asked to read and write using this and they have evaluated their performance by conducting exams.
                             They have noticed that, the performance extended far beyond making proper sentence syntax. This device can easily map to different languages and is been
                             tested all over the world, she said. She stated that “technology alone will solve nothing; rather it need socio-economic contents to make a good
                             relationship”.
