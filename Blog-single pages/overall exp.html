                            <h3>Overall Experience: RAHA Conf 2016.</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">Everything started from the day of registration for RAHA Conference. Actually,
                              I wasn't interested in registering because I haven't gone home for a while, and if I participate in RAHA I
                               will have to reduce my days at home. But, due to the pressure applied to me by my senior pushed me to register
                               for it :P. (No offence). But, I never thought it would be such a great experience. I would be regretting now if I haven't
                                been a volunteer for RAHA. The experience I got, the people I got to know is tremendous. </p>

                                 <p class="text-justify">Raha conference actually started on 18th December 2016, But there were Workshops for school children which were taken by FOSS members.
                                   There were other tutorials on topics like  Introduction to Robot Navigation using Robot Operating System etc on 17th December 2016. </p>

                                   <p class="text-justify">Only on 16th, our end sem exams, my first end sem exam of First year finished. I could only put forth an average performance by my side,
                                     though. Don’t know why is it because of the paper was quite tough or any other. But hoping for the best.
After the exam itself, we were called for a meeting in a room to teach us about what we have to present the workshop for school children. We had a explained class on CNC. It was quite interesting.
 How to use it how to automate cutting the desired shape or design. Hence all were wrapped up for the next day. Apart from this from 18th we were volunteered for the Social media team for RAHA conf.
 I will discuss this afterwards.
</p>
                            <div class="row">
                              <div class="col-xs-6 col-lg-4">
                            <img class="RAHA" src="../img/Post images/non-techie/RAHA/tag and token.jpg">

                                <h5>RAHA volunteer Tag with Food Tokens.</h5>

                          </div>
                          <div class="col-xs-12 .col-sm-6 col-lg-8">
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                  So 17th started off. I reached college as early as possible (Actually, I am late to college always :P), Fortunately,
                                  the works for us wasn’t started that soon. We interacted with people in AMMACHI labs the research lab of Amrita University.
                                  They were quite good, must say. We were discussing what to be done and what not to be followed during the session what we will be taking.
                                  Hence, After reaching there we starting helping those guys in the arrangement of the hall and things like that. They provided the Tags for RAHA conference,
                                  A volunteer tag. As usual, we need that to enter for anything. Also, we got the Food tokens to get our food. It was quite exciting to get all of these as it was the first
                                  time as we were attending an international event. The Tag and stuff made us like officials for the conference and with that we were able to get into any
                                   places any workshop as we were for helping :P. Actually, for me, the volunteer's card was like a pass for me to get into any places where a talk or workshop is happening
                                   like anything and listen to them. where people had paid to get a chance to listen to these speakers and attend the workshop.
                                </p>
                              </div>
                              </div>
                              <br>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                  We were asked to get our breakfast done and start our work. Our workshop only starts at noon.
                                   By that time we were asked to help in other workshops going on.
                                   There was a workshop on ROS (Robotic Operating System) on the first-floor lab and we
                                   had to help setting up the systems and help participants while they found any technical issues.
                                   Sounds fun right. Unfortunately, I was made the lab in charge. Haha, It sounded terrible, thinking
                                   like I will have to work a lot but nothing much was there.

                                   We had our breakfast really fast as it was the first day of our volunteers and wasn’t interested in
                                   ruining things up and get a bad image on FOSS :P.  Must say, The breakfast was awesome. Being honest I
                                   never thought that this much good food could be provided from amrita other than in canteens :P
                                 </p>
                                 <div class="row">
                                   <div class="col-xs-6 col-lg-4">
                                 <img class="RAHA" src="../img/Post images/non-techie/RAHA/lunch.jpg">
                                 <div class="rahaflyer">
                                     <h5>That's our awesome lunch for the day.</h5>

                                   Then we went to the first-floor lab and we were setting up ubuntu in virtual box. We were helping them while they were stuck.
                                    It dealt with the command line and we had prior experience with that. Hence, that helped out. The ROS was an entirely new topic for me.
                                    While running around the lab helping others I found out some time to sneak peek into what the speaker was saying.

                                    It was the actual use of being a volunteer. We could get into any talk any workshop for free without any hazel and listen to them.
                                    After a lot of running, we were contacted by a person and asked us to update the schedule of RAHA.org site. We started working on that too.
                                    That was something interesting too.

                                    After that we went to help for another workshop, it was a workshop for kids, a hands-on session on Robotics. They were excited to see these things.
                                    After that session, we went to lunch. God! That was really nice. Enjoyed each bite of it.
                                    It was a blend of flavours. Everything was available which enlightened our taste buds. Don't know why it felt that good. It might be because the expectations were low. :P
                                 </p>

                               Now started our actual work. The workshop was started off by M-Tech students and after that, we FOSS-ians started to take the session.
                                Students were really amused to see that they were able to carve in their name and designs they liked, they were having their names carved into Polystyrene and
                                taken with them. They were doing it by themselves and we were telling them how to. Students were enjoying a lot.
                                They were curving out things which they found interest. We were guiding them along to complete their preferred task without any issue.
                                 We had to take care of the machines too as it was quite costly and any damage could be fatal for us lol :P.
                                 We made them familiar with 3d-printer as well with the CNC. We made them use CNC and use the software controlled the machine.
                                  We taught them to jog the machine to their preferred position.
                                 (Jogging in robotic terms means to move the object/hand/lever to positions in x-y-z co-ordinates manually with the software).
                                 This will help to know the movement of the device.
                                That was really a great experience on the first day itself.

                                We actually were mesmerised with the first section itself that we took all from there and after we were past the half of our plate we got to know that there were
                                 other sections too. Even though, We never gave up on it :P The delegates, the speakers all had their dinner here itself. The students who came to attend the workshops and the listeners all

                             From the next day onwards we were in the social media team. It sounds awesome right :P. Actually, we were tweeting everything happening around into twitter.
                              What was the actual merit is that we could get into any talk want and listen to the authors. I will post different blog post on these days comprising what
                              they talked and presented during these days. These people were talking mostly talking about the reforms that could be brought with the intervention of robotics
                              to our world. Most of the talks were out of my scope :P but got a overall outline what they wished to convey. It was really nice to know that we have a really great
                              future with such devices and for the betterment of the world. It could make the life of the people better. Help people in better ways. The authors wanted to make their
                               ideas available for the entire world and improve them to make it applicable real life situation. I will write different post though explaining what they all talked.
