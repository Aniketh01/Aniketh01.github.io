                            <p class="text-justify">This day was the last day of the whole conference. Whole new idealogies and techniques in the robotics world were
                              discussed and many were to be discussed yet more. It was a grand finale of what all happened the following days, So It was started of grandly

                                  Dr. Jeffrey Sachs is a world renowned economist from the Earth Institute, and gave his talk via a live Skype call to the audience.
                                  He congratulated Amrita University on the work that is being done by them. He began his talk by saying that India is one of the pioneers in the
                                  field of IT, and is now going through a demonetization phase. He believes that India will have a historic transformation in the coming year, and
                                  recommended that debit cards be replaced with thumb prints. He also greatly described the different Sustainable Development Goals and how India can
                                   achieve all of them. He said that by developing cutting edge technologies, India can surely achieve the SDGs. The government of India has said
                                   that all of the village in the country will get electricity by May 2017. That is about 6000 villages, and he said a challenge for India is to
                                   provide energy that is clean. He said all the SDGs eventually tie back to SDG 1, which is a No Poverty. To end his talk, he said that india can
                                   do a lot with Africa to achieve SDGs, and he encouraged this collaboration to happen. During the talk he said that, Slowly introducing IT into the

                                   Then it was by Professor Subir Kumar Saha from IIT Delhi started his keynote by introducing IIT Delhi and his lab. He showed video of some of the
                                   robotics equipment in his lab. He explained the concept of robotics for education and his collaboration with Japan, and also gave an idea about
                                    mechatronics, simulators and its applications. He showcased his publications and research activities happening in his lab that includes the
                                    involvement of his team in robotics competitions and paper presentations. He also showed a demonstration of a carpet scrapping machine (Carpet

                                    to improve processes, tools and machines involved in the manufacturing of carpets was initiated by IIT Delhi in 2000. In the project,
                                    optimisation of a metallic loom was carried out for its reduced weight and cost.), which
                                     provided a systematic approach to improve the existing tools and processes used by artisans engaged in carpet sectors. This effort had been

                               Then it was the turn of Brent Gillespie from University of Michigan had his research in the area of the haptic interface, where he applied techniques
                               from multibody dynamics, nonlinear controls, and robotics. He introduced the virtual teacher, a device or agent that supplements an environment
                               in order to facilitate acquisition by a human user of a manual skill. A virtual teacher generally acts as an aide or facilitator to task execution
                               and is present only during training periods. During eventual task performance the teacher is absent. The virtual teacher’s objective is to promote
                                independent mastery over the task. He showed the different application of this teacher and pupil relationship in robotics, which was very interesting.
                                 He proposed a model-based cancellation controller to reduce the effects of biodynamic feedthrough where the controller processes vehicle acceleration
                                  measurements through a transfer function model of the human biodynamics, and a motor imposes the result as the torque that acts directly on the
                                   manual control interface. This had a positive effect on the disturbance response of the driver-vehicle system.

                                to design novel exoskeletons and robotic braces and focus on how neuromuscular systems respond in new human environments. He showed snapshots of
                                different products developed in the lab such as dynamic spine brace for correcting upper body postures which can be used to treat patients suffering
                                 from cerebral palsy and scoliosis, and dynamic Neck brace for treating patients suffering from Parkinson's and Cervical Dystonia. These exoskeletons
                                 were also used as an assistive device for gait training of stroke patients with paralysis to correct their asymmetric movements. Clinical outcomes
                                  were shown and he stated that there are significant differences before and after training. Another important product he introduced was the

                                finger exoskeleton for stroke and rehabilitation. These designs are based on finger motion trajectory in order to emulate the motion of varying
                                instantaneous axis. The main motivation behind these exoskeletons is to develop the connection between brain and kinematics of the exoskeleton during
                                 the physiotherapy. Dr Ashish Dutta had shown the importance of BCI paradigms to establish the control of fingers exoskeleton and the patient.
                                 He stated that the BCI interface forces the patient to focus on physiotherapy exercises and the results showed that the patient’s recovery is
                                 improved by adopting this method. The functions of physiotherapist were replaced by the exoskeletons. He showed different versions of the
                                 exoskeletons used; three finger exoskeleton was used for translation and rotation movements and a simplified two finger exoskeleton for open and

                               loss of internet connection due to cyclone and difficulty in detection of missing ships and flights and the need for deployment of sensors. Even though
                                there are many underwater robots to solve this issues, they are complex and expensive. So their aim was to develop a simpler underwater robot for the
                                 humanitarian purpose. He discussed the existing autonomous underwater robots ROVs and AUVs and the limitations with them. He told that they have
                                 already implemented and tested several remotely controlled and operated robots, even one for defence, but it was not really helpful. This inspired
                                 them to develop much simpler method rather than robots. “We don’t really need robots to solve the underwater facilities; we can use much simpler
                                 technologies instead,” Dr Ashokan said. They aimed to develop a suitable deployment system for underwater observation system for selective deployment
                                  operation. Thus they have introduced a variable buoyancy (VB) system for selective under water deployments like surveillance, search and rescue
                                   operations. </p>

                               The concept of the proposed system was to change the buoyancy of an object according to the depth and to control its up and down motion.
                                He also explained the various applications of the proposed system, such as standalone VB modules with hooks for salvaging, cable connected VB modules
                                for selective positioning of sensors, modules for back packs for divers etc. The proposed system was a combination different modules with specific tasks
                                 which are connected to the base station. And also, to study the system they have done mathematical modelling and tested it. He said that if he has a
                                 ship with multiple modules, he can add it on different depths and can collect the info at a different position. He concluded that buoyancy forces in
                                 underwater can be effectively used for underwater wave motion and variable buoyancy modules can be developed as a stand-alone system for a selective
                                  mission.

                                   Dr Shankar our Dean,  talked about the various projects that are at Amrita University, and the impact that they have on the people who they are
                                    meant to help. He mentioned that Amrita University is just 14 years old, and has a ranking as the number 1 private university in India. His talk
                                     followed a discussion of what makes Amrita University grow so fast. It is because Amrita has a specific mission and target goal that
                                     differentiates them from other universities. He discussed the haptic technologies and women empowerment projects of AMMACHI Labs and their impact
                                      on the rural populations. He pointed out a statistic that showed that if we train the men, the output will be 40%, but for women, it is 100%.
                                      He also talked about the Amrita Wireless Networks (WNA) in disaster management and landslide detection, as well as Amrita’s Humanitarian
                                       Technologies Lab (HuT). He concluded with a beautiful quote by Amma, the Chancellor of Amrita University, and discussed the science behind
                                       humanitarianism. It was a poignant way to end the last keynote address of RAHA 2016.
